This is a HUD for my car that uses GPS for speed and heading. It also has a light sensor for auto brightness control. It updates significantly faster than the 1 or 2hz of cheap HUDs from places like aliexpress.


parts:

Adafruit trinket M0

Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout

adafruit LED Charlieplexed Matrix - 9x16 LEDs - Red

Adafruit 16x9 Charlieplexed LED Matrix Driver 

adafruit GA1A12S202 Log-scale Analog Light Sensor


Unfortunately the LEDs that adafruit uses for these matrices stop working at moderately high temperatures. Individual LEDs would stop working until they cooled down.
